#Mastering JavaScript Single Page Application Development
This is the code repository for [Mastering JavaScript Single Page Application Development](https://www.packtpub.com/web-development/mastering-javascript-single-page-application-development?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repository&utm_campaign=9781785881640), published by Packt. It contains all the supporting project files necessary to work through the book from start to finish.
##Instructions and Navigations
All of the code is organized into folders. Each folder starts with a number followed by the application name. For example, Chapter02.



The code will look like the following:
```
module.exports = function(grunt) {
 grunt.initConfig({
 pkg: grunt.file.readJSON('package.json'),
```

The book requires very few pieces of software besides your web browser and your
operating system's command line or terminal. You will need an editor for writing code. Any
text editor will do, from Notepad to an IDE such as Jetbrains WebStorm.
